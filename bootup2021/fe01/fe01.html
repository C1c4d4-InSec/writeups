The challenge asks you to download a file, fe03.zip with no other information.
Upon downloading it, I tried unzipping it with unzip...no luck, only errors
After a bit of googling, 7za x 'filename' should work to open the file.
Success! Except that the file is password protected.
In comes Zydra, a python script based on the idea of Hydra, only for zipped files.
Combine Zydra with the Rockyou.txt list! That is sure to crack most things in a CTF.
Ok. The python script is giving an error about utf-8 encoding. Let's return to google.
Conveniently, there are others who had the same issue on the GitHub page for Zydra.

Thank you, mlowczynski! <a href='https://github.com/mlowczynski'>
Just a little code altering in the script; changing open(dict_file, "r") to open(dict_file, encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore')
    at all the points it occurs in the script. Save time by using the vim search feature. (/'search string')
Save and exit! :wq!
Success once more! Zydra is working perfectly.

Waiting...
Waiting...
Waiting...
Waiting...Rockyou really is a long list...Let's hope it gets longer!

Ok. So this isn't working.
Should have tried this to begin with: John The Ripper!
zip2john flag.zip > hash.txt
john --filetype=zip hash.txt

John doing it's magic.

Super fast this time! We have a match.

Unzip the file:

Success this time!
cat that flag file!

We have the flag!
